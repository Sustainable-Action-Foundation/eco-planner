/** 
 * Fun to see:
 *  - If all keys exist in all locales.
 *  - Collect all keys and make a page of them to visually inspect.
 * 
 * Things to test and validate:
 *  - All english base keys exist in all locales. (maybe default count key?)
 *  - All keys used in the app exist in all locales.
 *  - Keys used in the app not directly referencing common namespace.
 *  - Values in common don't exist in other namespaces. Should reference common.
